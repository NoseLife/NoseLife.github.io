*We learn as we teach others*

For anyone who is interested in field lab tools [for soil quality and plant pathology] and what might be referred to [in the medical or veterinary realm] as point-of-care diagnostic technology, you might want to *get your hands* [or eyeballs] on a [digital] copy of [Graphene, Carbon Nanotubes, and Nanostructures: Techniques and Applications](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/graphene-carbon-nanotubes/9781466560574/). It might not include everything that is out there, but this CRC Press reference manual offers a rather broad, general review of most of the groundbreaking [circa July 2017] research in nanofabrication technology. It also explores a lot, probably most of applications that nanofabrication has enabled. As part of this review, it also furnishes a lot of background examining the historical evolution and emerging trends of nanofabrication and supplies an analytical understanding of some of the most important underlying nanofabrication technologies, with an emphasis on graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and nanowires.  Of course, the table of contents provides a quick glimpse at the scope of this review but it is really worth taking more of a look at the text itself ... and a high level *view from 30,000 feet* is what this posting is about.
