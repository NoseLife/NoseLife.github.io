### Abstract

[Biosensor technology improvement](http://www.mdpi.com/search?q=biosensor&authors=&article_type=&journal=sensors&section=&special_issue=&search=Search) is so vitally important in different realms that it is almost impossible to keep up with. Microfabrication techniques in nanotechnology continue to not only improves sensitivy and accuracy of sensors but the reduced form factor of these sensors greatly enables things such as point-of-care (POC) diagnostics and other highly portable biosensing technologies to greatly reduce waiting times and to improve the quality of living, biological lab specimens by eliminating delays and various handling uncertainties in transporting the rapidly degrading biological specimen to the lab. Moreover, label-free detection allows for greater versatility in the detection of biological molecules by recording raw data immediately in the field with portable and automated sensing systems that assure repeatability and reproducability of measurement data.  Those data can then be further processed and analyzed in detail by advanced artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) algorithms on more powerful computing systems to yield a comprehensive, intelligent image accurately reflecting the full character of the biological sample. This approach to gathering high quality raw data from living [or very recently living] samples in the field and then processing that data later is completely revolutionary step forward in biological laboratory analysis.

## Introduction

Macromolecule (eg protein, virus) and cell-based biosensors and biofunctional devices such as microelectrode arrays (MEAs) have become increasingly invaluable tools for scientific discovery, biological multifunctional characterization and all kinds of biotechnological advancement in medicine, animal health, plant pathology ad other realms. Since they can actively electrochemically manipulate and monitor cellular activity both at the molecular, single cell and cellular network levels, they provide extraordinary insight into complex biological interactions. As of 2018, first-generation biosensor MEAs are used in applications as far ranging as drug screening, toxicity testing, cardiac pacing and epilepsy research. Due to the size of the macromolecules, cells and biofluids involved, which are in the scale of microns, micro/nanofabrication has beocme not just an attractive, but a necessary technique for developing and manufacturing such biofunctional sensors. The technology of microfabricated biosensor MEAs has been an active area of research, first reported almost fifty years ago for multifunctional characterization such as macromolecular stimulation and recording from patterned electrically active cells on these sensor arrays.

In the past [and still today], silicon has served as the substrate of choice for the microfabrication and assembly of such biosensor arrays due to mature microfabrication technologies used in the semiconductor industry, the ability to integrate complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) electronics technology with MEA technology, and advanced tool sets that exist for the fabrication of MEAs manufactured from silicon. Two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and CMOS-integrated biosensor arrays have been reported by several groups. Successful commercialization of such devices has become common. However, when applying MEA technology to in vitro biological assays transparency for inverted microscopy becomes an important biofunctionality consideration since traditional in vitro cell cultures are observed, monitored and manipulated from the bottom-side. Transparency additionally enables content-based assays (optical images) in addition to information-based assays (electrical signals), opening up new multifunctional applications for these devices. As a result, there is a need for transparency in the substrate of choice utilized to fabricate MEAs. Since silicon is not transparent, a different approach is necessary, but not all approaches have equal merit for biosensors.  As the application areas for such cell-based biofunctional sensors increase dramatically, the disposable nature of the device will loom as an increasingly important consideration. Even though glass-based microfabrication is an effective, transparent technology for the development and manufacturing of biosensor microelectrode arrays, disposability is hard to achieve. 

Manufacturability and design-for-assembly is also an important consideration. Cost-effective technologies that can either minimize the usage of cleanroom-based processes and substrates or perform processing in large-area formats for low-cost micromanufacturing are key toward such a pursuit. Printed circuit board (PCB) processing is still a likely candidate for such approaches since it satisfies both criteria using large area processes that are performed outside the cleanroom. There are basically unmodified printed circuit board (PCB) process that has been utilized to fabricate low-cost biosensors for applications such as disposable neural and cardiac biosensing applications. They utilize all standard PCB process steps such as drilling, photo printing, via plating, electroless plating and either laser micromachining or electromicromachining to fabricate relatively large (~75–100 µm electrodes are relatively large in the scale which nanotechnologist operate) microelectrodes. Such sensors take advantage of panel-based fabrication approaches, dramatically reducing costs when compared to wafer-based processes. Since this process is an unmodified PCB approach, FR-4 and Kapton are used as substrates for the MEA. It is an efficacious technique for micromanufacturing MEAs but there are some down sides to this approach. Obviously, these substrate materials are neither transparent nor biocompatible. Thus, there exists an extensive but unmet demand for cost-effective biomacromolecular and cell-based biofunctional sensor arrays such as MEAs that can be produced from alternative microfabrication approaches that utilize technologies from the PCBs and packaging disciplines. If these approaches take advantage of reel-to-reel or roll-to-roll processing or panel-based approaches, they can truly produce cost-effective, transparent biosensor arrays that can be “used and tossed” or made entirely disposable.
